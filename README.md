# RaspberryPi-433MHz-Remote-Switches-Web-Controller
This project provides a web api, written in python, to control cheap Remote Control Switches based on 433 MHz via a Raspberry Pi. It also provides a web interface for a handy use of the API. All you need is a 433 MHz RF transmitter for a few bucks. Have fun!
